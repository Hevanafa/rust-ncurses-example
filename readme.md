# Rust + Pancurses + Kira
An example text-based game with SFX player.
I chose `kira` for the audio player because `rodio` was too hard to use.

# How to Start
1. Clone the repo
2. `cargo build --release`
3. `.\target\release\rand_trees`

# How to Play
Walk with the arrow keys.  Walk into the trees to cut them.
